Few months back, I bought Alexa dot because it was cheap and compact in size. My sister saw it and asked me to get her one too. However, she didnâ€™t want the exact same thing. So I looked at Amazon and was going through the reviews. There were so many varities. Each had more than 1000 reviews and had mixed reactions which made it difficult for me to decide on one good product. While googling, I came across this dataset in Kaggle.

Dataset overview- It consists of a nearly 3000 Amazon customer reviews (input text), star ratings, date of review, variant and feedback of various amazon Alexa products like Alexa Echo, Echo dots, Alexa Firesticks etc.

I thought, being a Data Scientist, I would learn how to train machine for sentiment analysis.
